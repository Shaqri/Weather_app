## Use your API key

If you want to add your own API key from the openWeather API, you can do so by creating a file in the root folder called '.env' and set your API key by following the example in .env-sample. 

### Usage

- Cities can be searched by their name, or if you want to be more specific, you can type the name, state, and country space separated in the search bar input.

- If the inputted city is mistyped, doesn't exist, or simply the API request is not reaching that city weather information, the app will display an error below the search input.
